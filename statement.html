        <p id=statement>
        This project was created with the assistance of Github's built-in copilot 
        chat. I rarely use Copilot to generate my work, but to explore it for the 
        requirements of this assignment, I explored responses from the chatbot rather
         than using google forums like I normally would. Whenever I got stuck, I would 
         ask the chat why I'm not getting my desired result and it would explain to me 
         a possible solution as to how I could fix it. Something I miss about forum posts, 
         though, like on stack overflow, is the greater detail into the context of which 
         users explain their solutions and why they work. When creating my second endpoint, 
         I noticed that the inline recommendations had strikingly accurate generations to 
         what I was about to type. It was helpful to be able to quickly glance to make sure 
         it's correct, then press tab to save a second each couple lines. If I had to 
         estimate, I'd say that those inline recommendations had about an 80% accuracy 
         rate after I had made my first function.
